### Composit Design Pattern

A tree structure of simple and composite objects. Compose an object into tree structure to represent a whole part hierarchies.

**Sample Case**
1. An organization tree
2. Graph implementation
3. File or Directories

**When to use it**
1. Hierarchical representations of objects are required.
2. A single object and a group of objects should be treated in the same way
