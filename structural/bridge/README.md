### Bridge Design Pattern

Bridge design pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

**Sample Case**
1. Multiple payment method for business transaction
2. OS scheduling implementation

**When to use it**
1. Abstractions and implementations should be modified independently
2. Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients
