### Strategy Design Pattern

This pattern allows a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at run-time and gives it a simple way to access it.  

**Sample Case**
1. Switching algorithm implementation
2. Various payment method

**When to use it**
1. There are multiple strategies for a given problem and the selection criteria of a strategy is defined a run-time.
2. The strategies use the data to which the client has no access.
