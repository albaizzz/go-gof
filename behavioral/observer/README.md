### Observer Design Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects: observable and observers. An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.  

**Sample Case**
1. News Channel
2. Event Broadcast

**When to use it**
1. Changes in state of an object need to be notified to a set of dependent objects, not all of them.
2. Notification capability is required.
3. The object sending the notification does not need to know about the receivers objects.
